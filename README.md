## First Segment Presentation (30 points)
### Selected Topic
Medical Marijuana
### Reason Topic Selected 
To help medical marijuana patients select appropriate strains to treat their respective ailments 
### Source Data Description
The Kushy cannabis dataset on GitHub is a collection of tabular data from different sectors of the industry, from strains to products to lab results:

### Data Analysis Goal
Determine which medical marijuana strains are best suited as treatment for specific ailments

## Communication Protocols
* Create direct messages for only team members in dedicated Slack channel
* Weekly meetings on Tuesday/Thursday during class and [Friday/Sunday afternoons?] 
* Emergency contact information (email/mobile) provided by each team member
* Emergency contact [Jemi Shieh] 24/7 by Slack/email/text/call as needed

## Team Role Distribution
### GitHub Repository (10 points) – Paul Erlic
Create the following GitHub repository:
* Main Branch including .gitignore and README.md files with team members as collaborators
* Individual Branches for each team member including at least four commits each during the first segment

### Machine Learning Model (35 points) – David Bastien
Create a provisional machine learning model that stands in for the final machine learning model and accomplishes the following:
* Takes in data from the provisional database
* Outputs label for input data

### Database Integration (25 points) – Jemi Shieh
Create a provisional database that stands in for the final database and accomplishes the following:
* Begin to clean, organize, and perform exploratory data analysis on the datasets to prepare for analysis
* Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure or schema
* Draft machine learning model is connected to the provisional database

### Technology Architect – Ashley Mayes
Help decide which technologies will be used for each step of the project as follows:
#### Technologies Used
##### Data Cleaning and Analysis
Excel will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Pandas and Python.
##### Database Storage
PostgreSQL is the database we intend to use.
##### Machine Learning
[SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a clustering algorithm. Our training and testing setup is ___. Extra ML verbiage here such as adding Python, Google Colab and Jupyter Notebook]. 
##### Dashboard
We will be using Tableau to create a fully functioning and interactive dashboard.

### Dashboard (0 points)
There are no deliverables associated with the dashboard for this segment.
